# The Simon Game

Welcome to the Simon Game project! This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game, where players need to remember and repeat a sequence of colors that gets progressively longer. Go ahead and play the game [here](https://amlansahoo07.github.io/simon-game/).

## Overview
This project recreates the Simon game using HTML, CSS and jQuery. The game starts when the user presses a key or taps the screen and involves clicking colored buttons in the correct sequence. The sequence length increases with each level, providing an engaging challenge for the player. Additionally, the design is responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across various devices.

This project is inspired and developed as part of [Angela Yu's Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)'s Boss Challenge on Udemy. It serves as a hands-on exercise to practice jQuery and advanced JavaScript principles. While following the exercise instructions, I have also taken creative liberties in making the design responsive and adding a togglable Instructions button.
